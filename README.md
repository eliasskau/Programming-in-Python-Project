Dear Students,
You are required to design a software for a school. The software allows the user to enter student's data, edit and save them to a text file. The program should have the following functions:
1- Adding a new record 
This includes adding student name, address, class, grades in 5 subjects (Math, Science, English, Dutch, Arts). This function should be able to deal with the situation in which the user inputs the wrong format.
2- Deleting a record
In this function, the use should enter the first and the last name of the student that he wants to delete. Then, the software should ask the user to confirm that the record will be deleted. 
3- Editing a record
The user should enter the first and the last name of the student he wants to edit. Then, the software should ask the user, which field he wants to edit. The software should be able to deal with the wrong input format as well. 
If the user tries to edit or delete a student that is not in the database, then he should get a message that the student is not in the database. Please try to AVOID the crash of the program due to the wrong input of the user.
4- Search students by first or last name. Also, the program should be able to list all students in a given class.
5- The program should be able to calculate the total and average grades for each student. Also the average grades for students in the same class and print which class is having the highest average.
The project may be done by a team of 3-to-4 students. However, you have to submit a final report in which you describe briefly how to run the project and to state the contribution of each student. PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO TEST THE PROGRAM SEVERAL TIMES TO MAKESURE THAT ALL THE FUNCTIONS WORK FINE AND THE SOFTWARE IS ABLE TO DEAL WITH WRONG INPUT FORMAT. 
Your final submission should include 3 files: 1- The code 2- A text file that includes a small database you entered yourself for me to test your program 3- The pdf report, that includes the manual and the contribution of each student.
Good Luck
